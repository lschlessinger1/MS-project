# Code locally disables the following messages:
# R0204 - redefined_variable_type - gives false negatives for conditionals (https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/710)
# W0201 - attribute-defined-outside-init - gives false negatives when attribute is defined in method called within init.

[TYPECHECK]

# List of module names for which member attributes should not be checked
# (useful for modules/projects where namespaces are manipulated during runtime
# and thus existing member attributes cannot be deduced by static analysis. It
# supports qualified module names, as well as Unix pattern matching.

# List of classes names for which member attributes should not be checked
# (useful for classes with attributes dynamically set). This supports can work
# with qualified names.
